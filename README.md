# Nintendo Switch Theme for RetroPie
Over the last few days I have been working on this theme further. I updated all the icons a few days ago and decided to update the rest of the theme. 

### Changelog:

- Fixed bugs:
  - Fixed game card icon squished in 4:3 mode
  - Fixed some minor technical bugs
- Changed background to look more like the official Switch
- Fixed squished gamecard icon by changing the file format to a png
- Made colour scheme a lot more similar to the Nintendo Switch's
